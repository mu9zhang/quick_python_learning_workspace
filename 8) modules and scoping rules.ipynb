    "What is a module?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Modules are used to organize larger Python projects. The Python standard library is split into modules to make it more manageable. You\n",
    "   don’t need to organize your own code into modules, but if you’re writing any programs that are more than a few pages long or any code\n",
    "   that you want to reuse, you should probably do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A module is a file containing code. It defines a group of Python functions or other objects, and the name of the module is derived from\n",
    "   the name of the file.Modules most often contain Python source code, but they can also be compiled C or C++ object files. Compiled modules\n",
    "   and Python source modules are used the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. As well as grouping related Python objects, modules help avert name-clash problems. Each module has its own namespace, which helps prevent\n",
    "   naming conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Modules are also used to make Python itself more manageable. Most standard Python functions aren’t built into the core of the language\n",
    "   but are provided via specific modules, which you can load as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. If you change your module on disk, retyping the import command won’t cause it to load again. You need to use the reload function from\n",
    "   the importlib module for this purpose. The importlib module provides an interface to the mechanisms behind importing modules. When\n",
    "   a module is reloaded (or imported for the first time), all of its code is parsed. A syntax exception is raised if an error is found.\n",
    "   On the other hand, if everything is okay, a .pyc file (for example, mymath.pyc) containing Python byte code is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Summarize:\n",
    "   -- A module is a file define Python objects.\n",
    "   -- If the name of the module file is modulename.py, the Python name of the module is modulename.\n",
    "   -- You can bring a module named modulename into use with the import modulename statement. After this statement is executed, objects\n",
    "      defined in the module can be accessed as modulename.objectname. \n",
    "   -- Specific names from a module can be brought directly into your program by using the from modulename import objectname statement.\n",
    "      This statement makes objectname accessible to your program without your needing to prepend it with modulename, and it’s useful for\n",
    "      bringing in names that are often used.\n",

    "The import Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The import statement takes three different forms. The most basic is:\n",
    "   (*) import modulename\n",
    "   which searches for a Python module of the given name, parses its contents, and makes it available. The importing code can use the contents\n",
    "   of the module, but any references by that code to names within the module must still be prepended with the module name. If the named\n",
    "   module isn’t found, an error is generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second form permits specific names from a module to be explicitly imported into the code:\n",
    "   (*) from modulename import name1, name2, name3, . . . \n",
    "   Each of name1, name2, and so forth from within modulename is made available to the importing code; code after the import statement can use\n",
    "   any of name1, name2, name3, and so on without your prepending the module name.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Finally, there’s a general form of the from . . . import . . . statement:\n",
    "   (*) from modulename import *\n",
    "   The * stands for all the exported names in modulename. from modulename import * imports all public names from modulename — that is, those\n",
    "   that don’t begin with an underscore — and makes them available to the importing code without the necessity of prepending the module name.\n",
    "   But if a list of names called __all__ exists in the module (or the package’s __init__.py), the names are the ones imported, whether or not\n",
    "   they begin with an underscore.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You should take care when using this particular form of importing. If two modules both define a name, and you import both modules using\n",
    "   this form of importing, you’ll end up with a name clash, and the name from the second module will replace the name from the first. This\n",
    "   technique also makes it more difficult for readers of your code to determine where the names you’re using originate.\n",

    "The Module Search Path\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Exactly where Python looks for modules is defined in a variable called path, which you can access through a module called sys.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It indicates a list of directories that Python searches (in order) when attempting to execute an import statement. The first module found\n",
    "   that satisfies the import request is used. If there’s no satisfactory module in the module search path, an ImportError exception is\n",
    "   raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The sys.path variable is initialized from the value of the environment variable PYTHONPATH, if it exists, or from a default value that’s\n",
    "   dependent on your installation. In addition, whenever you run a Python script, the sys.path variable for that script has the directory\n",
    "   containing the script inserted as its first element, which provides a convenient way of determining where the executing Python program is\n",
    "   located. In an interactive session, the first element of sys.path is set to the empty string, which Python takes as meaning that it should\n",
    "   first look for modules in the current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  In a production environment, you won’t be running Python interactively, and Python code files won’t be located in your current\n",
    "    directory. To ensure that your programs can use the modules you coded, you need to:\n",
    "    -- Place your modules in one of the directories that Python normally searches for modules.\n",
    "    -- Place all the modules used by a Python program in the same directory as the program.\n",
    "    -- Create a directory (or directories) to hold your modules, and modify the sys .path variable so that it includes this new directory\n",
    "       (or directories).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The first is apparently the easiest and is also an option that you should never choose unless your version of Python includes local code\n",
    "   directories in its default module search path. Such directories are specifically intended for site-specific (that is, code specific to\n",
    "   your machine) and aren’t in danger of being overwritten by a new Python install because they’re not part of the Python installation.\n",
    "   If your sys.path refers to such directories, you can put your modules there.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The second option is a good choice for modules that are associated with a particular program. Just keep them with the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The third option is the right choice for site-specific modules that will be used in more than one program at that site. You can modify\n",
    "   sys.path in various ways. You can assign to it in your code, which is easy, but doing so hardcodes directory locations into your program\n",
    "   code. You can set the PYTHONPATH environment variable, which is relatively easy, but it may not apply to all users at your site;\n",
    "   or you can add it to the default search path by using a .pth file.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. For PYTHONPATH, the directory or directories you set it to are prepended to the sys.path variable. If you use PYTHONPATH, be careful\n",
    "   that you don’t define a module with the same name as one of the existing library modules that you’re using. If you do that your module\n",
    "   will be found before the library module. In some cases, this may be what you want, but probably not often.\n",

    "Python Scoping Rules and Namespaces\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The core concept here is that of a namespace. A namespace in Python is a mapping from identifiers to objects—that is, how Python keeps\n",
    "   track of what variables and identifiers are active and what they point to. So a statement like x = 1 adds x to a namespace (assuming that\n",
    "   it isn’t already there) and associates it with the value 1. When a block of code is executed in Python, it has three namespaces:\n",
    "   local, global, and built-in.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When an identifier is encountered during execution, Python first looks in the local namespace for it. If the identifier isn’t found,\n",
    "   the global namespace is looked in next. If the identifier still hasn’t been found, the built-in namespace is checked. If it doesn’t\n",
    "   exist there, this situation is considered to be an error, and a NameError exception occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  For a module, a command executed in an interactive session, or a script running from a file, the global and local namespaces are the same.\n",
    "    Creating any variable or function or importing anything from another module results in a new entry, or binding, being made in this\n",
    "    namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. But when a function call is made, a local namespace is created, and a binding is entered in it for each parameter of the call. Then a new\n",
    "   binding is entered into this local namespace whenever a variable is created within the function. The global namespace of a function is the\n",
    "   global namespace of the containing block of the function (that of the module, script file, or interactive session). It’s independent of\n",
    "   the dynamic context from which it’s called.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  In all of these situations, the built-in namespace is that of the __builtins__ module. This module contains, among other things, all\n",
    "    the built-in functions you’ve encountered (such as len, min, max, int, float, list, tuple, range, str, and repr) and the other built-in\n",
    "    classes in Python, such as the exceptions (like NameError).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. One thing that sometimes trips up new Python programmers is the fact that you can override items in the built-in module. If, for example,\n",
    "   you create a list in your program and put it in a variable called list, you can’t subsequently use the built-in list function. The entry\n",
    "   for your list is found first. There’s no differentiation between names for functions and modules and other objects. The most recent\n",

You still need to use importlib.reload if you want to\\n   pick up changes made to a file. \\n', 'In', 'Out', '_', '_12', '_13', '_14', '_20', '__', '___', '__builtin__', '__builtins__', '__doc__', '__loader__', '__name__', '__package__', '__spec__', '_dh', '_g', '_i', '_i1', '_i10', '_i11', '_i12', '_i13', '_i14', '_i15', '_i16', '_i17', '_i18', '_i19', '_i2', '_i20', '_i21', '_i22', '_i23', '_i24', '_i25', '_i26', '_i27', '_i28', '_i29', '_i3', '_i30', '_i31', '_i32', '_i33', '_i4', '_i5', '_i6', '_i7', '_i8', '_i9', '_ih', '_ii', '_iii', '_oh', 'a', 'exit', 'f', 'get_ipython', 'globals_info', 'importlib', 'locals_info', 'modtest', 'mymath', 'pi', 'quit', 'scopetest', 'sys', 'x', 'x1', 'z']\n"
