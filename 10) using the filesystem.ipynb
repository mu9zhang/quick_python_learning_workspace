    "1. The traditional way that file paths and filesystem operations have been handled in Python is by using functions included in the os\n",
    "   and os.path modules. These functions have worked well enough but often resulted in more verbose code than necessary. Since Python 3.5,\n",
    "   a new library, pathlib, has been added; it offers a more object-oriented and more unified way of doing the same operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. All operating systems refer to files and directories with strings naming a given file or directory. Strings used in this manner are\n",
    "   usually called pathnames (or sometimes just paths). The fact that pathnames are strings introduces possible complications into working\n",
    "   with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Pathname semantics across operating systems are very similar because the filesystem on almost all operating systems is modeled as a tree\n",
    "   structure, with a disk being the root and folders, subfolders, and so on being branches, subbranches, and so on. This means that most\n",
    "   operating systems refer to a specific file in fundamentally the same manner: with a pathname that specifies the path to follow from\n",
    "   the root of the filesystem tree (the disk) to the file in question. This pathname consists of a series of folders to descend into to\n",
    "   get to the desired file.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Different operating systems have different conventions regarding the precise syntax of pathnames. The character used to separate\n",
    "   sequential file or directory names in a Linux/UNIX pathname is /, whereas the character used to separate file or directory names in a\n",
    "   Windows pathname is \\. In addition, the UNIX filesystem has a single root, whereas the Windows filesystem has a separate root for\n",
    "   each drive, labeled A:\\, B:\\, C:\\, and so forth. Because of these differences, files have different pathname representations on different\n",
    "   operating systems. A file called C:\\data\\myfile in MS Windows might be called /data/myfile on UNIX and on the Mac OS.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. These operating systems allow two types of pathnames:\n",
