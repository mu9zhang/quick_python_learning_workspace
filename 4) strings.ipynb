    "2. Basic escape sequences:  \\' \\\" \\\\ \\a \\b \\f \\n \\r \\t \\v\n",

    "   hexadecimal(base 16) escape sequence corresponding to that character. An octal escape sequence is a backslash followed by three digits\n",
    "   defining an octal number; the ASCII character corresponding to this octal number is substituted for the octal escape sequence.\n",
    "   A hexadecimal escape sequence is with backslash x rather than just backslash and can consist of any number of hexadecimal digits.\n",
    "   The escape sequence is terminated when a character is found that’s not a hexadecimal digit. \n",

    "   the Unicode character set includes the common ASCII characters.\n",

    "5. A string that’s evaluated at the top level of an interactive Python session is shown with all of its special characters as octal escape\n",

    "3. The functions string.maketrans and string.translate may be used together to translate characters in strings into different characters.\n",
    "   The method maketrans() make up a translation table from its two string arguments. The two arguments must each contain the same number of\n",
