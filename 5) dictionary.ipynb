    "Basic Dictionary Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In Python 3.5 and earlier, the order of the keys in a list returned by keys has no meaning; the keys aren’t necessarily sorted,\n",
    "   and they don’t necessarily occur in the order in which they were created. Your Python code may print out the keys in a different order\n",
    "   than my Python code did. If you need keys sorted, you can store them in a list variable and then sort that list. However, starting with\n",
    "   Python 3.6, dictionaries preserve the order that the keys were created and return them in that order.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The keys, values, and items methods return not lists, but views that behave like sequences but are dynamically updated whenever the\n",
    "   dictionary changes. That’s why you need to use the list function to make them appear as a list in these examples. Otherwise, they behave\n",
    "   like sequences, allowing code to iterate over them in a for loop, using in to check membership in them, and so on. The view returned by\n",
    "   keys (and in some cases the view returned by items) also behaves like a set, with union, difference, and intersection operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Attempting to access a key that isn’t in a dictionary is an error in Python. To handle this error, you can test the dictionary for\n",
    "   the presence of a key with the in keyword, which returns True if a dictionary has a value stored under the given key and False.\n",
    "   Alternatively, you can use the get function. This function returns the value associated with a key if the dictionary contains that key,\n",
    "   but returns its second argument if the dictionary doesn’t contain the key. The second argument is optional. If that argument isn’t\n",
    "   included, get returns None if the dictionary doesn’t contain the key.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. If you want to safely get a key’s value and make sure that it’s set to a default in the dictionary, you can use the setdefault() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The copy() method makes a shallow copy of the dictionary, which is likely to be all you need in most situations. For dictionaries that\n",
    "   contain any modifiable objects as values (for example, lists or other dictionaries), you may want to make a deep copy by using the\n",
    "   copy.deepcopy function.\n",
    "   \n",
    "6. The update() method updates a first dictionary with all the key-value pairs of a second dictionary. For keys that are common to both\n",
    "   dictionaries, the values from the second dictionary override those of the first.\n",

    "1. Any Python object that is immutable and hashable can be used as a key to a dictionary.\n",

    "3. The requirement that keys be immutable and hashable means that lists can’t be used as dictionary keys, but in many instances, it would\n",
    "   be convenient to have a listlike key.  Python solves this difficulty by providing tuples, which are basically immutable lists; they’re\n",

    "4. Keys must also be hashable, which takes things a step further than just immutable. To be hashable, a value must have a hash value\n",
    "  (provided by a __hash__ method) that never changes throughout the life of the value. That means that tuples containing mutable values are\n",
